                    In today's lab, ma'am observed our gestures, postures, and personalities. At first, she seemed strict, but once she started speaking, I was impressed—especially by her diverse academic background. She also shared some stories, which made the session more engaging. She has a personality that fills everyone with enthusiasm and creates a motivated and positive learning environment—exactly the kind of personality every career skills teacher should possess.

                        Towards the end, we played a really interesting game called <b>Chinese Whisper</b>. She made us stand in a queue, then whispered a phrase to the first person. Each of us had to pass it along to the next, and by the time it reached the last person, the phrase had completely changed!

                In today's session, ma'am taught us about the outer appearance of a person, which is the first impression of a person. She gave some examples where a person's appearance can make or break their chances of success. Then she told us how to make a CV with all necessary details.

                    Then ma'am conducted an activity where she instructed us to tear a page's edges accordingly—fold, tear right edge, left edge, and so on. Again, she instructed us to take another paper and repeated the same steps. When we opened the pages, we saw that both the pages had different patterns, even though the instructions were the same!

                In today's session, ma'am told us about the importance of soft skills—how soft skills help us get ahead of others and create a positive impact. She shared a story that highlighted the importance of soft skills. After that, an activity was conducted which showed how luck, skill, hard work, and the right attitude play important roles in our lives. Even if you are hardworking, have the best luck and money, but if you don't have the right attitude, then you can't achieve success.

                Today ma'am was really upset as some students cheated in the mid-term practical and the students thought that ma'am would not know about this, but they were caught. Ma'am told us that cheating in life would never help us as it would only make us cowards, not stronger. Then she told about her husband who was fearing to do some task, but ma'am told him not to fear and to complete the task, not to make any excuses to avoid it. She told us to face challenges and not to run away from them.

                Today's session was all about Group Discussion. Ma'am told us how a GD is conducted, explained some rules related to it, and conducted GDs. Ma'am told us that the starting of the GD should be impactful and so should the conclusion. She also told us to keep a pen and paper to jot down the points in GD to remember the key points of the topic. A GD is conducted to know how well we can outshine among people with different mentalities.
